yahoo,yahooSplit_Business and Finance_shuffled,8,2,"Is $ 75,000 . 00 a year income a good income ? OR . . . . should I opt for $ 35 . 00 an hour instead ? >>>>> Depends , are you going to work more than an hour of overtime a week ? If so , you 'll get more money if you go with the hourly , otherwise , working 40 hour weeks , 75K / yr will gross you about 2K more . A yearly salary is wonderful , especially for budgeting purposes . [[It_1]] is n't affected by sick leave or vacation time , and you are n't going to lose out on money just because you are n't there . Hourly feels better when the job is involves long nights or extra weekends ( something you may have to do anyway if you are on salary ) ; but adds variance to your paycheck . Personally , because I do n't get sick often , I like my work , and I like the idea of putting in an extra hour when I need to so I can make an extra buck , I 'd go with the hourly . But if the whole guaranteed check makes you happy , do [[it_2]] instead .",2,3,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

Also if you have any metal allergies , like to nickel , I reccommend that you do NOT get pierced . [[It_4]] is a bigger pain then [[it_5]] is worth . Literally .

The blandness in music has nothing to do with scale structure , because [[it_1]] would be near impossible to make one not loosly based on a scale , [[it_2]] is musicians not expanding their knowledge of scales and the different ways to use them . And metallica uses the phygian scale much more than pentatonic , the pent . is freaking boring .

Various things such as smoking , drinking alcohol or taking drugs , OR being hit in the head hard enough to sustain a concussion , will accelerate brain cell loss . But just like with the rest of your body , you also grow new brain cells every day . Therefore , if you get hit in the head and are experiencing some thinking problems -- lack of memory , concentration , etc. -- you will PROBABLY get back most or all of your brain function as long as you do n't do anything to aggravate the situation .

A whole lot depends on the willingness of the patient , and his / her skill in closely controlling the blood sugar . Character plays an important part , as someone who is lazy or likes to drink too much is n't going to do a very good job controlling their blood sugar . Also , depends on other health factors . If you got bad genes for arteriosclerosis apart from the diabetic factor , then you got more problem . Also , the newer insulins and self check glucometers really help the determined to control their sugars .

[[It_2]] seems to be the topic of some rather intersting Science Fiction series . >>>>> Area 51 , also known as Groom Lake , is a secret military facility about 90 miles north of Las Vegas . The number refers to a 6 - by-10 - mile block of land , at the center of which is a large air base the government will not discuss . The site was selected in the mid-1950s for testing of the U-2 spyplane , due to [[it_3]] s remoteness , proximity to existing facilities and presence of a dry lake bed for landings . Groom Lake is America 's traditional testing ground for "" black budget "" aircraft before they are publicly acknowledged . The facility and surrounding areas are also associated -- with varying levels of credibility -- with UFO and conspiracy stories . In 1989 , Bob Lazar claimed on a Las Vegas television station that he had worked with alien spacecraft at Papoose Lake , south of Area 51 . Since then , "" Area 51 "" has become a popular symbol for the alleged U. S. Government UFO cover - up .

yahoo,yahooSplit_Science and Mathematics_shuffled,9,2,"how does a snake breathe ?? >>>>> The trachea in reptiles is similar to that of higher vertebrates , with well - developed hyaline rings . However , there is no mucociliary transport mechanism to aid the removal of foreign substances from the respiratory tract . Furthermore , the absence of a diaphragm prevents the animal from coughing . The lungs are similar to the avian - type system with a series of reticulated open - ended sacs and many capillaries in close proximity . The cranial part of the reptile lung is the gaseous exchange portion , while the caudal part functions as an air sac . The latter may act as a reserve of air during periods of apnoea . Alveolar macrophages are present in the reptilian lung , but may display poor bacterial removal if the animal is being kept below [[it_1]] s optimal temperature . In snakes , the right lung is larger than the left , and generally stretches from the heart to the kidney . [[It_2]] may extend even further down to the cloaca in some aquatic snakes . Some snakes have a tracheal lung on the dorsal aspect of the trachea , which enables the snake to breathe when the main lung is compressed by swallowed prey .",2,2,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

But this is oil again and this can still pollute , so Hydrogen by far is the best fuel that we have come up with as when Hydrogen is burnt , the only product is water vapor .
